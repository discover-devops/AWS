AWS **scenario-based AWS interview questions** that cover real-world use cases and challenges. These questions test your practical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and ability to design scalable, secure, and cost-effective solutions using AWS services.  

---

### **1. EC2 and Auto Scaling**  
**Scenario:**  
Your application is experiencing unpredictable traffic spikes. The current setup uses EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). However, during high traffic, the response time increases significantly.  
**Question:**  
- How would you redesign the architecture to handle unpredictable traffic spikes efficiently?  
- What changes can you make to ensure **auto-scaling** happens faster to reduce latency?  

---

### **2. Amazon S3 and Security**  
**Scenario:**  
You need to store sensitive customer data in S3. The data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Additionally, only specific IAM users from your AWS account should have access to the data.  
**Question:**  
- How would you implement a solution to secure the data in S3?  
- How do you enable **cross-account access** securely while ensuring least privilege?  

---

### **3. RDS High Availability**  
**Scenario:**  
A production MySQL database running on Amazon RDS must have high availability and failover capability. The database experiences heavy read operations, and performance is degrading during peak hours.  
**Question:**  
- How would you design the RDS solution to ensure high availability?  
- How can you offload read operations without impacting the primary database’s performance?  

---

### **4. AWS Lambda and Serverless**  
**Scenario:**  
You are building a serverless application that processes files uploaded to an S3 bucket. After processing, the results must be stored in DynamoDB. The file processing is compute-intensive and can vary in complexity.  
**Question:**  
- How would you design this solution to ensure scalability and low latency?  
- How would you handle long-running file processing tasks that exceed Lambda’s **15-minute execution limit?**  

---

### **5. Amazon VPC and Networking**  
**Scenario:**  
You are tasked with designing a **multi-tier architecture** in AWS with public-facing web servers and private backend servers. The backend servers must not be accessible directly from the internet.  
**Question:**  
- How would you design the VPC to ensure secure communication between tiers?  
- How can you expose the web tier to the public while keeping the database tier private?  

---

### **6. Amazon CloudFront and Latency Optimization**  
**Scenario:**  
Your users are distributed globally, and they report high latency when accessing static assets from your application. These assets are currently stored in an S3 bucket.  
**Question:**  
- How would you reduce latency for global users accessing static content?  
- What measures can you take to ensure **content invalidation** happens quickly after updates?  

---

### **7. Elastic Load Balancer (ALB/NLB)**  
**Scenario:**  
Your application requires the ability to route traffic to different microservices based on the request path (e.g., `/api/orders` to one service and `/api/users` to another).  
**Question:**  
- How would you design the load balancing architecture to achieve path-based routing?  
- Which type of load balancer would you use, and why?  

---

### **8. DynamoDB Performance Optimization**  
**Scenario:**  
A DynamoDB table storing user activity logs is experiencing hot partition issues. The table receives a large number of writes for a small subset of partition keys.  
**Question:**  
- How would you redesign the table schema to prevent hot partitions?  
- What are the best practices to **distribute writes evenly across partitions?**  

---

### **9. AWS IAM and Access Control**  
**Scenario:**  
A development team needs temporary access to a production S3 bucket to troubleshoot an issue. You want to grant access for a limited time without permanently modifying permissions.  
**Question:**  
- How would you implement a solution to grant temporary access?  
- How do you audit which users accessed the bucket and what actions they performed?  

---

### **10. Amazon ECS/EKS (Containers)**  
**Scenario:**  
You need to migrate an existing microservices application running on EC2 instances to containers using ECS. The application requires communication between services, and some services need persistent storage.  
**Question:**  
- How would you design the ECS cluster to manage communication between services?  
- How do you handle **persistent storage for containerized applications?**  

---

### **11. AWS CloudFormation (IaC)**  
**Scenario:**  
Your organization wants to automate infrastructure deployment across multiple regions using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The infrastructure must be consistent across all regions.  
**Question:**  
- How would you design the CloudFormation templates to deploy infrastructure to multiple regions?  
- How can you handle region-specific resources within a single CloudFormation stack?  

---

### **12. AWS CloudWatch and Monitoring**  
**Scenario:**  
Your application logs errors during high traffic, but you cannot pinpoint the root cause quickly. Logs are collected in CloudWatch, but searching and analyzing them is time-consuming.  
**Question:**  
- How would you design a solution to **automate anomaly detection** and alert the team in real time?  
- How do you use **CloudWatch Logs Insights** to query logs efficiently?  

---

### **13. Amazon Route 53 and Failover**  
**Scenario:**  
You run a web application with servers in two regions for disaster recovery. If the primary region becomes unavailable, traffic should automatically shift to the secondary region.  
**Question:**  
- How would you configure Route 53 to implement **automatic failover**?  
- How do you ensure minimal downtime during failover events?  

---

### **14. AWS Direct Connect and VPN**  
**Scenario:**  
A financial services company needs to establish a dedicated, high-bandwidth connection between their on-premises data center and AWS. Low latency and high reliability are critical.  
**Question:**  
- How would you choose between **AWS Direct Connect** and **VPN?**  
- How can you ensure failover between Direct Connect and VPN in case of connectivity issues?  

---

### **15. AWS Glue and Data Pipelines**  
**Scenario:**  
Your company processes large amounts of data daily from various sources. The data needs to be transformed and loaded into Redshift for analytics.  
**Question:**  
- How would you design a data pipeline using AWS Glue?  
- How can you optimize Glue jobs for large datasets to minimize costs and processing time?
