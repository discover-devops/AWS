#  **AWS Shield Tutorial — Step-by-Step Overview**

##  What is AWS Shield?

| Feature    | AWS Shield Standard       | AWS Shield Advanced                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Cost       | **Free**                  | **Paid** (monthly + data charges)                  |
| Protection | Automatic DDoS protection | Advanced detection + mitigation                    |
| Coverage   | All AWS customers         | ALB, CloudFront, Route 53, EC2, Global Accelerator |
| Extras     | —                         | Cost protection, 24/7 DDoS response team (DRT)     |

---

##  **Use Cases**

* Protect web apps (ALB + CloudFront) from:

  * Volumetric attacks (UDP floods, SYN floods)
  * State exhaustion (connection floods)
  * Application layer (L7) HTTP floods

---

##  **AWS Shield Standard — Automatically Enabled**

You **don’t have to do anything** to enable it:

* It is **built-in** to services like ALB, CloudFront, Route 53
* Monitors and automatically mitigates Layer 3 and 4 DDoS attacks

 View metrics under:

* **CloudWatch → AWS/DDoSProtection**
* **WAF & Shield → Protected Resources**

---

##  **AWS Shield Advanced — Manual Setup (Paid)**

> Enables **enhanced protections**, **cost safeguards**, and **24/7 support**

###  Step-by-Step: Enable AWS Shield Advanced

1. Go to **AWS Console → WAF & Shield**

2. Click **AWS Shield → Protected Resources**

3. Click **Enable AWS Shield Advanced**

4. Choose the resources to protect:

   * ALBs
   * CloudFront distributions
   * Route 53 hosted zones
   * Global Accelerators
   * EC2 EIPs

5. Attach **Protection Group** (e.g., “prod-web-tier”)

6. (Optional) Enable **Proactive Engagement** — gives access to AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT)

7. Confirm **cost protection** if eligible

---

##  **Shield + WAF Integration**

* Use **Shield Advanced** with **WAF** to:

  * Automatically detect application-layer DDoS attacks
  * Create rate-based WAF rules dynamically
  * Access **mitigation summaries** in the Shield console

---

##  **Testing DDoS Protection (Simulated)**

AWS does **not recommend** generating synthetic DDoS traffic.

 Instead:

* Use **CloudWatch Metrics** to monitor:

  * `DDoSAttackBitsPerSecond`
  * `DDoSAttackPacketsPerSecond`
* Review **Shield Advanced Event Logs** for threat history

##  **Best Practices**

| Category          | Recommendation                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resource Coverage | Always protect ALB, CloudFront, and Route 53 with Shield |
| Cost Protection   | Shield Advanced reimburses scaling costs during attack   |
| Logging           | Enable Shield Advanced logs to CloudWatch or S3          |
| Alerts            | Create CloudWatch alarms on `DDoSDetected` metric        |
| Support           | Contact AWS DRT if under attack (via Shield console)     |

##  Summary

| Shield Version      | Use Case                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shield Standard** | Default protection for most apps                                                   |
| **Shield Advanced** | Required for regulated workloads, enterprise SLAs, or mission-critical public apps |
