# **highly secure, scalable AWS web application**

#  **Security Analysis of the Architecture**

---

##  **1. Front-End Security (User to AWS)**

| Component          | Security Role                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Route 53**       | Secure DNS management. Can use **DNSSEC** to prevent spoofing.                                                          |
| **AWS WAF**        | Protects against web attacks like **SQLi**, **XSS**, **bot scraping**, and **bad IPs**. Rules can be managed or custom. |
| **AWS CloudFront** | Global **CDN** with **HTTPS** support; caches content and reduces direct hits to origin (reduces exposure).             |
| **AWS Shield**     | **DDoS protection** â€“ Standard is free; Advanced protects against larger, more complex attacks.                         |

**ðŸ›¡ Benefit:** Front-end is well protected from Layer 3â€“7 attacks before reaching your application.

---

##  **2. Network Security (VPC Level)**

| Element             | Security Value                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VPC**             | Isolates the entire app in a **private cloud** (not shared).                                |
| **Public Subnets**  | Only **NAT Gateway** and **Load Balancer** are public-facing â€” NOT app or DB servers.       |
| **Private Subnets** | Web, App, and DB servers are **isolated** from the internet.                                |
| **NAT Gateways**    | Allow **outbound internet access** from private subnets **without exposing them publicly**. |

**ðŸ›¡ Benefit:** Attack surface is minimized â€” only the Load Balancer is exposed to users.

---

##  **3. Application Security (Web & App Tier)**

| Layer                 | Security Controls                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web EC2 Instances** | Placed in **web subnet**, **behind Load Balancer**, only allow traffic from ALB. Use **Web SG**.            |
| **App EC2 Instances** | In private app subnet, can **only receive traffic from Web tier**. Use **App SG** with tight inbound rules. |

**Additional Best Practices:**

* Enable **instance-level IAM roles** for least privilege.
* Use **SSM Session Manager** instead of SSH for admin access (no open ports).
* Harden AMIs and use **patch management** via SSM.

##  **4. Data Security (Database, Caching, Storage)**

| Component              | Security Implementation                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon RDS**         | Encrypted with **KMS**, placed in **private DB subnet**, accessible only from **App SG**          |
| **RDS Multi-AZ**       | Ensures **HA** + automatic failover.                                                              |
| **Amazon ElastiCache** | Provides **encrypted in-transit and at-rest Redis/Memcached** caching. Isolated in DB subnet.     |
| **Amazon EFS**         | Can use **EFS encryption**, private mount points. Access via **mount targets in private subnet**. |

**ðŸ›¡ Benefit:** No public exposure. Data is encrypted and access-controlled using IAM + SG + subnet isolation.

---

##  **5. IAM & Access Control**

| Practice                            | Benefit                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IAM Roles for EC2**               | Only needed permissions granted (e.g., read from S3, write to CloudWatch). |
| **No hardcoded secrets**            | Use **AWS Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store** for DB/API secrets. |
| **IAM policies scoped to services** | Fine-grained access to prevent privilege escalation.                       |

---

##  **6. Logging & Monitoring (Implied Best Practice)**

Though not shown, you should add:

* **CloudTrail** â†’ API activity tracking
* **VPC Flow Logs** â†’ Monitor subnet-level traffic
* **CloudWatch** â†’ Logs, metrics, alarms
* **GuardDuty** â†’ Threat detection for accounts, IAM anomalies, DNS-based attacks

#  **Security Highlights in This Architecture**

| Security Layer          | Services & Techniques                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Perimeter**           | AWS WAF, Shield, CloudFront                                       |
| **Network**             | VPC, Private Subnets, NAT                                         |
| **Access Control**      | IAM roles, SGs, least privilege                                   |
| **Data Security**       | RDS encryption, private subnets, EFS, Secrets Manager             |
| **Logging**             | (Should add) CloudTrail, GuardDuty, VPC Flow Logs                 |
| **Zero Trust Approach** | No direct access â€” everything passes through layers of validation |

##  If You Were to Deploy This:

1. Set up VPC with public and private subnets across AZs
2. Set up S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and WAF
3. Deploy NAT Gateways in each AZ for private subnet outbound access
4. Deploy ALBs (Web & App layer), connected to Web ASG and App ASG
5. Use IAM roles, SGs, and subnets to enforce least privilege and isolation
6. Encrypt all data (RDS, EFS, ElastiCache) with KMS
7. Enable GuardDuty, CloudTrail, and VPC Flow Logs
